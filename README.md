The Travel Style Finder is a data-driven application that helps travelers find destinations that best suit their preferences. 
By leveraging clustering algorithms, the application groups locations based on factors such as popularity, reviews, and pricing. 

The goal is to make travel planning easier and more insightful by categorizing destinations into meaningful groups.
Traveling can be overwhelming with so many choices available. Our project aims to simplify this process by offering users a smart way to explore destinations that align with their travel styles. 
Whether someone is looking for a luxurious getaway, an affordable adventure, or a hidden gem, our application provides personalized insights. By analyzing travel trends and user behavior, we strive to create an intuitive tool that makes trip planning seamless and enjoyable. 

Our goal is not just to classify destinations but to give them meaning, helping travelers make informed decisions with confidence.
